# Ferro Framework

## What This Is

A developer experience and agent-friendliness optimized web framework for Rust. Ferro enables AI agents to build complete web applications from natural language descriptions — with reduced boilerplate, deep introspection via MCP, and intelligent CLI scaffolding.

## Core Value

Agents can go from "I want an app that does X" to a working, deployed application with minimal friction. Every framework decision optimizes for agent comprehension and generation capability.

## Requirements

### Active

<!-- Current scope. Building toward these. -->

- [ ] Publish to crates.io (manual step using PUBLISHING.md)
- [ ] Public announcement and marketing

### Out of Scope

<!-- Explicit boundaries. Includes reasoning to prevent re-adding. -->

- New major features (payments, subscriptions, etc.) — focus is publishing, not feature expansion
- Frontend framework changes — React/Inertia stack stays as-is
- Database driver changes — SeaORM works, no need to replace

## Context

**Current State:**
- 60,000 lines of Rust across 11 crates
- Framework ready for crates.io publication
- Sample application demonstrating all capabilities
- Comprehensive MCP introspection (30+ tools)

**Tech Stack:**
- Rust 2021 edition
- Axum web framework
- SeaORM database layer
- React/Inertia.js frontend
- Redis for queue/cache/broadcast

**Primary use case:** Agent-built applications for non-technical users. This requires:
- Patterns simple enough for agents to reliably generate
- Introspection deep enough for agents to understand existing code
- Error messages clear enough for agents to self-correct

Reference codebase documentation in `.planning/codebase/`:
- ARCHITECTURE.md — Layer breakdown and request lifecycle
- STACK.md — Dependencies and tooling
- PATTERNS.md, HOTSPOTS.md, TESTING.md, CONVENTIONS.md, DOCUMENTATION.md

## Constraints

- **Compatibility**: Existing sample app works with framework
- **Rust Edition**: 2021 edition, no nightly-only features

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions that constrain future work. Add throughout project lifecycle. -->

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Agent-first over developer-first | Non-technical users via agents is the target market | ✓ Good |
| Breaking changes acceptable | No backwards compatibility constraint allows cleaner APIs | ✓ Good |
| FerroModel derive on entities | Apply derive to entity files (auto-generated) not model files | ✓ Good |
| ValidateRules not Validate | Avoid conflict with validator crate's `Validate` derive | ✓ Good |
| Tool vs Resource for MCP | Implemented features as tools rather than MCP resources for simpler agent consumption | ✓ Good |
| Rebrand to "ferro" | Name appropriate for crates.io publication and public release | ✓ Good |
| Alias pattern for migration | Keep code imports working during phased rename | ✓ Good |

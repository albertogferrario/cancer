## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Detailed decisions archived in milestone files.

### Pending Todos

None — all milestones complete.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Pre-existing (unrelated to milestones):**
1. ferro-storage has unimplemented trait methods
2. Flaky shared state in test_different_methods_tracked_separately
3. test_globals_css_not_empty expects tailwind in CSS

These do not block crates.io publishing.

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.0 DX Overhaul complete: 12 phases, 18 plans (2026-01-15 to 2026-01-16)
- v2.0 Rebrand complete: 10 phases, 13 plans (2026-01-16)
- All planned work complete

## Next Steps

Manual steps remaining (not GSD-tracked):

1. **Publish crates to crates.io** using `PUBLISHING.md` checklist
2. **Announce public release** on Rust forums, social media

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-16
Status: Project complete

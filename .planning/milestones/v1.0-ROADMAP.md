# Milestone v1.0: DX Overhaul

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-16
**Phases:** 1-12
**Total Plans:** 18

## Overview

Transform the Ferro web framework from developer-centric to agent-first. The journey starts with reducing boilerplate in core patterns (handlers, models, validation), expands MCP introspection for agent comprehension, improves CLI scaffolding for feature-level generation, and concludes with polish that makes the entire framework self-documenting and agent-friendly.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Handler Simplification

**Goal**: Reduce boilerplate in handler function definitions
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 01-01: Sample App Handler Modernization

### Phase 2: Model Boilerplate Reduction

**Goal**: Derive more from SeaORM models, write less boilerplate
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 02-01: FerroModel Derive Macro Integration

### Phase 3: Validation Syntax Streamlining

**Goal**: More concise validation rule definitions
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 03-01: Validate Derive Macro

### Phase 4: Convention-over-Configuration

**Goal**: Smart defaults reduce explicit configuration for common scenarios
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 04-01: Convention-over-Configuration

### Phase 5: MCP Intent Understanding

**Goal**: Agent can understand full app intent, not just structure
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 05-01: MCP Intent Understanding

### Phase 6: MCP Error Context

**Goal**: Better error context for agent diagnosis
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 06-01: Error Context Enhancement

### Phase 7: MCP Relationship Visibility

**Goal**: Relationship and data flow visibility through MCP
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 07-01: Relationship Visibility Tools

### Phase 8: MCP Generation Hints

**Goal**: Generation hints embedded in introspection responses
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 08-01: Generation Hints

### Phase 9: CLI Feature Scaffolding

**Goal**: Higher-level scaffolding that generates full features, not just files
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 09-01: Feature Scaffolding

### Phase 10: CLI Smart Defaults

**Goal**: Smarter defaults based on existing codebase patterns
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Plans**: 1

- [x] 10-01: Smart Defaults

### Phase 11: CLI Component Integration

**Goal**: Better integration between generated components
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Plans**: 3

- [x] 11-01: FK Detection & Test-Factory
- [x] 11-02: FK-Aware Generation
- [x] 11-03: Controllers & Pages

### Phase 12: Agent-First Polish

**Goal**: Clear, predictable patterns agents can learn; self-documenting code; actionable errors
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Plans**: 5

- [x] 12-01: Actionable Errors
- [x] 12-02: Self-Documenting Config
- [x] 12-03: Tailwind Out-of-Box
- [x] 12-04: Auto-Cleanup
- [x] 12-05: Inertia Redirect Fix

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Agent-first over developer-first - Non-technical users via agents is the target market
- FerroModel derive on entities - Apply derive to entity files (auto-generated) not model files
- ValidateRules not Validate - Named derive macro `ValidateRules` to avoid conflict with validator crate
- Tool vs Resource for Glossary - Implemented domain_glossary as tool rather than MCP resource
- Structured Description Format - Standardized on When/Returns/Combine format for all tool descriptions
- Category-specific fix prioritization - Fix suggestions have priority 1-5 where 1 is highest

**Issues Resolved:**
- Handler boilerplate reduced with #[handler] macro
- Model boilerplate reduced with FerroModel derive
- Validation syntax streamlined with ValidateRules derive
- MCP expanded to 30+ introspection tools
- CLI scaffolding improved with smart defaults and FK detection
- Actionable error messages implemented

**Issues Deferred:**
- Action injection in handler macro (deferred until macro enhancement)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Pre-existing test failures in ferro-storage (unrelated to v1.0 work)
- Pre-existing metrics test flakiness
